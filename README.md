# Enum
Exams are no joke. They usually cover many topics, each building on top of each other. Studying for these exams is stressful because of the sheer content you need to know. We want to help reduce this stress by introducing a tool to help students study effectively and visualize the bigger picture. To help students better prepare for their exams, we created a tool that helps visualize the contents as well as the relationships among certain keywords in the subject material. 

Our map shows a cohesive story of course content which other study applications don't - we help students make connections between key ideas by linking them together in a content map. Rather than learning bits and pieces of everything and forgetting them later, we retrace and connect the dots, which in turn provides for meaningful and long-lasting learning.
