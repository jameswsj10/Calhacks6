9/11’ refers to the events that occurred on September 11th, 2001 during which members of al-Qaeda hijacked four airliners, resulting in suicide attacks against major targets in the United States of America.[1] Of the four aeroplanes, one struck the Pentagon, one crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, and the remaining two were flown into the Twin Towers in New York City.[2] Three thousand people lost their lives in the attacks, which President George W. Bush referred to as “a national tragedy.”[3] However, the consequences were to be long term. In the immediate aftermath, President Bush gave a simple explanation, stating, “America was targeted for attack because we’re the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining.”[4] Although a short explanation was given, President Bush knew that the causes for such an attack were far more complicated and the consequences even more so.

 The causes of 9/11 can be split into two sub-headings. Firstly, the causes which were claimed by al-Qaeda and secondly, motivations which have been suggested which were not explicitly declared by al-Qaeda. 

Within Osama bin Laden’s contact with the Western press he points to four main causes of the 9/11 attacks. Firstly, within his “Letter to America” he refers to the United States support of Israel over the Arab states as a cause for attack, stating:

The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals… And of course, there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel.
