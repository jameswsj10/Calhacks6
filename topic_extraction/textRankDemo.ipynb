       "'9/11’ refers to the events that occurred on September 11th, 2001 during which members of al-Qaeda hijacked four airliners, resulting in suicide attacks against major targets in the United States of America.[1] Of the four aeroplanes, one struck the Pentagon, one crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, and the remaining two were flown into the Twin Towers in New York City.[2] Three thousand people lost their lives in the attacks, which President George W. Bush referred to as “a national tragedy.”[3] However, the consequences were to be long term. In the immediate aftermath, President Bush gave a simple explanation, stating, “America was targeted for attack because we’re the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining.”[4] Although a short explanation was given, President Bush knew that the causes for such an attack were far more complicated and the consequences even more so.\\n \\n  The causes of 9/11 can be split into two sub-headings. Firstly, the causes which were claimed by al-Qaeda and secondly, motivations which have been suggested which were not explicitly declared by al-Qaeda. \\n \\n Within Osama bin Laden’s contact with the Western press he points to four main causes of the 9/11 attacks. Firstly, within his “Letter to America” he refers to the United States support of Israel over the Arab states as a cause for attack, stating:\\n \\n The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals… And of course, there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel.'"

       "\"At first the study of organic chemistry involves understanding the energy\\n and shapes of simple organic structures. Then the study progresses to more\\n complicated three-dimensional structures and finally to the investigation of reactions\\n of organic molecules. We use the theories of bonding and the facts about acidic or\\n basic properties of the molecules to understand the overall picture of what is\\n happening. But the overall goal is to improve mankind through the development of\\n new and better processes to be applied in medicine, agriculture and biomedical\\n science, that is to make life better. Thus we must be able to study difficult molecules\\n too.\\n As you proceed through organic chemistry you will write many different\\n structures, and the writing gets easier with practice. But in the beginning it can be\\n confusing. Always remember that carbon has four bonds!\\n In writing an alkane such as pentane which has five carbon atoms. We\\n could write it by just showing carbon atoms, but it does not show carbon with four bonds. \\n More correctly it needs all of its hydrogen atoms, but writing all the\\n hydrogen atoms for compounds becomes cumbersome. Thus we write condensed\\n structures as shown below. With some experience, we can write pentane as the line\\n structure with the ends and the points representing carbon atoms, and we know that\\n the hydrogens are there without writing them. Carbon compounds also exist in rings, called cyclic compounds. Below is\\n the compound called cyclohexane written several different ways. Even in the most\\n condensed structures you must realize that all the carbon atoms and all the hydrogen\\n atoms are present even though the C's and H's are not written. These shorthand\\n methods of writing structures are very helpful in speeding up the writing of\\n equations, and thus understanding them is necessary. \""

       "'Public Key Cryptography\\n In this note, we discuss a very nice and important application of modular arithmetic: the RSA public-key\\n cryptosystem, named after its inventors Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman.\\n The basic setting for cryptography is typically described via a cast of three characters: Alice and Bob, who\\n with to communicate confidentially over some (insecure) link, and Eve, an eavesdropper who is listening in\\n and trying to discover what they are saying. Let’s assume that Alice wants to transmit a message x (written\\n in binary) to Bob. She will apply her encryption function E to x and send the encrypted message E(x) over\\n the link; Bob, upon receipt of E(x), will then apply his decryption function D to it and thus recover the\\n original message: i.e., D(E(x)) = x.\\n Since the link is insecure, Alice and Bob have to assume that Eve may get hold of E(x). (Think of Eve\\n as being a “sniffer\" on the network.) Thus ideally we would like to know that the encryption function E is\\n chosen so that just knowing E(x) (without knowing the decryption function D) doesn’t allow one to discover\\n anything about the original message x.\\n For centuries cryptography was based on what are now called private-key protocols. In such a scheme,\\n Alice and Bob meet beforehand and together choose a secret codebook, with which they encrypt all future\\n correspondence between them. (This codebook plays the role of the functions E and D above.) Eve’s only\\n hope then is to collect some encrypted messages and use them to at least partially figure out the codebook.\\n Public-key schemes such as RSA, first invented in the 1970s, are significantly more subtle and tricky: they\\n allow Alice to send Bob a message without ever having met him before! This almost sounds impossible,\\n because in this scenario there is a symmetry between Bob and Eve: why should Bob have any advantage over\\n Eve in terms of being able to understand Alice’s message? The central idea behind the RSA cryptosystem\\n is that Bob is able to implement a digital lock, to which only he has the key. Now by making this digital\\n lock public, he gives Alice (or, indeed, anybody else) a way to send him a secure message which only he\\n can open.\\n Here is how the digital lock is implemented in the RSA scheme. Each person has a public key known to the\\n whole world, and a private key known only to him- or herself. When Alice wants to send a message x to\\n Bob, she encodes it using Bob’s public key. Bob then decrypts it using his private key, thus retrieving x. Eve\\n is welcome to see as many encrypted messages for Bob as she likes, but she will not be able to decode them\\n (under certain basic assumptions explained later in this Note).\\n The RSA scheme is based heavily on modular arithmetic.'"
