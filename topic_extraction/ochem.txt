At first the study of organic chemistry involves understanding the energy
and shapes of simple organic structures. Then the study progresses to more
complicated three-dimensional structures and finally to the investigation of reactions
of organic molecules. We use the theories of bonding and the facts about acidic or
basic properties of the molecules to understand the overall picture of what is
happening. But the overall goal is to improve mankind through the development of
new and better processes to be applied in medicine, agriculture and biomedical
science, that is to make life better. Thus we must be able to study difficult molecules
too.
As you proceed through organic chemistry you will write many different
structures, and the writing gets easier with practice. But in the beginning it can be
confusing. Always remember that carbon has four bonds!
In writing an alkane such as pentane which has five carbon atoms. We
could write it by just showing carbon atoms, but it does not show carbon with four bonds. 
More correctly it needs all of its hydrogen atoms, but writing all the
hydrogen atoms for compounds becomes cumbersome. Thus we write condensed
structures as shown below. With some experience, we can write pentane as the line
structure with the ends and the points representing carbon atoms, and we know that
the hydrogens are there without writing them. Carbon compounds also exist in rings, called cyclic compounds. Below is
the compound called cyclohexane written several different ways. Even in the most
condensed structures you must realize that all the carbon atoms and all the hydrogen
atoms are present even though the C's and H's are not written. These shorthand
methods of writing structures are very helpful in speeding up the writing of
equations, and thus understanding them is necessary.
